# Reconstructing-Images

Reconstructing compressed CUFS images using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implemented in PyTorch and Google Colaboratory.

Please note:
* Before running the Notebook, download the CUFS dataset images (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html) and put them into the 'imgs' subdirectory at CIS680/HW3/cufs and upload the CIS680 directory to Google Drive.
